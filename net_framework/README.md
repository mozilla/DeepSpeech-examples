## Quick Start

This example assumes that the model and the scorer exist in the execution directory. You can download the pre-trained models with the following:

```bash
# Download pre-trained English model files
curl -LO https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.3/deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm
curl -LO https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.3/deepspeech-0.9.3-models.scorer
```

You can also grab some of the example files with the following:

```bash
# Download example audio files
curl -LO https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.3/audio-0.9.3.tar.gz
tar xvf audio-0.9.3.tar.gz
```
